## Project Overview

The Titanic: Learnings project aims to analyze passenger data from the Titanic and predict survival using machine learning techniques. It provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates, such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-learnings.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the Titanic dataset: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, you can:

- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for detailed analysis and visualization of the Titanic dataset.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models by running the provided Python scripts.
- Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis phase involves exploring the Titanic dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and gaining insights into the relationships between different variables. We employ various data visualization techniques to understand patterns and correlations.
